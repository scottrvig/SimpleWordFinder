Website aide for Scrabble/Words With Friends.

This website can be used for helping (or as some say, cheating) during a Scrabble game.  This website has 4 helpful functions:

1. Word search: The user enters the letters they have on their rack (wildcards are supported), and the list of all English words that can be spelled is returned.
2. Hooks: The user enters a string of characters, and the list of all 'hooks' (valid English words that extend the string by 1 letter) is returned.  For example, valid hooks of "JAR" are "AJAR", "JARS", or "JARL".
3. Q without U: The list of valid Q without U English words is returned.
4. 2 letter words: The list of valid 2 letter English words is returned.

I made this website as a personal project to build some basic web development skills.  It's fast, ad-free, and simple to use.
